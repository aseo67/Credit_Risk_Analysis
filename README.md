## Overview of Analysis
LendingClub, a peer to peer lending services company, is exploring usage of machine learning to predict credit risk. This analysis builds and evaluates several machine learning models/algorithms to predict credit risk ("high_risk" vs. "low_risk"). The models tested are:
- Naive Random Oversampling (with _RandomOverSampler_ algorithm)
- SMOTE Oversampling (with _SMOTE_ algorithm)
- Undersampling (with _ClusterCentroids_ algorithm
- Combination (Over and Under) Sampling (with _SMOTEENN_ algorithm)
- 2 additional machine learning models that reduce bias
  - Balanced Random Forest Classifier (with _BalancedRandomForestClassifier_)
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier (with _EasyEnsembleClassifier_)

## Results

- Naive Random Oversampling
  - Balanced Accuracy Score: ~0.65

  - Precision: "high_risk" = 0.01, "low_risk" = 1.00
  - Recall: "high_risk" = 0.74, "low_risk" = 0.56
